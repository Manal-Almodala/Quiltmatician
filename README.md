# Quiltmatician
Quiltmatician is a fabric-cutting utility designed for quilters to minimize fabric used for cutting primitive shapes. 

Before a quilter begins a new project, they first start by planning how many "primitives" (commonly squares) they will need. From these primitives, other shapes and designs can be cut. When the number of primitives is small, one can calculate with little trouble how much fabric they will need. However, when the number of primtives is non-trivial and varying in size, determining a cutting pattern becomes a real headache, let alone knowing layout is optimal!
