# Quiltmatician
Quiltmatician is a fabric-cutting utility designed for quilters to minimize fabric used for cutting primitive shapes. 

Before a quilter begins a new project, they first start by planning how many "primitives" (commonly squares) they will need. From these primitives, other shapes and designs can be cut. When the number of primitives is small, one can calculate with little trouble a cutting pattern and how much fabric they will need. However, when the number of primtives becomes non-trivial and varying their sizes vary, determining an optimal cutting pattern becomes exponentially harder.
